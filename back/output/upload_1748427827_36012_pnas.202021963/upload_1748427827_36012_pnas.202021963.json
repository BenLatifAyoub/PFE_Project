(C) Schematic showing the analytical process for quantifying protein colocalization with repair foci by generating Monte Carlo randomized simulation images for each SR nucleus image and then using the number of overlaps in the random simulations to normalize the real data. For each cell, this normalized “colocalization ratio” can be plotted (e.g., one normalized cell value is circled in red) and compared with truly random levels (=1) and with control levels in untreated control cells. (D) The interrelationships between proteins localized to repair foci were further quantified by calculating the percentage of naDNA foci positive for one or both stained proteins. This determined the degree of colocalization between proteins at repair sites, as well as exclusion and dependence relationships. (E) The spatial relationship of pairs of proteins colocalized at repair foci could be determined by measuring the distance between the protein foci centers of mass and generating a histogram. This was then extrapolated to generate a protein–protein association distribution two-dimensional heat map. By staining RAD51 with two different fluorophores, we could model the expected association distribution for proximally associated proteins for comparison with proteins that are distally associated at repair foci. Representative foci show proximal and distal overlaps as observed in dual-stained RAD51 (proximal; magenta: naDNA, cyan/yellow: RAD51) and in MRE11 (cyan) and CtIP (yellow; distal; magenta: naDNA).
