C57BL/6 mice, implanted with mouse 005 GSCs on day 0, were treated with TMZ (25 mg/kg) or vehicle intraperitoneally from days 10 to 14, and G47?-mIL12 (5×105 pfu) or PBS injected intratumorally on day 12 (n=7 for mock and TMZ, and n=8 for G47?-IL12 and combination). Schema illustrated below. (B) Bodyweight of tumor- bearing mice (from A) after treatment. Mean±SEM, no significant differences between treated and mock (one- way ANOVA, Tukey's test post- test). (C) Kaplan- Meier survival curve for low- dose TMZ (7.5 mg/ kg); same experimental schedule as in (A). n=7 for mock and single treatments, n=8 for combination. Schema illustrated below. The long- term surviving mouse from the combination group was sacrificed on day 223, and tumor was not present. The median survival of mock (38 days) is significantly different from G47?-IL12 (median survival=49 days, p=0.003) or combination (median survival=54.5 days, p=0.002); TMZ (median survival=40 days) is significantly different from combination (p=0.0085). No other significant differences were observed. ANOVA, analysis of variance; GBM, glioblastoma; GSCs, GBM stem- like cells; TMZ, temozolomide.",
