(A) Effect of flavonolignans (at 90 mM dose) on the three dimensional growth of DU145 cells was studied as detailed in ‘Materials and Methods’. Representative spheroids photomicrographs are shown at 100x and 400x. (B) In Transwell invasion assay, either DU145 cells (plated in the lower chamber) or HUVEC (plated in the upper chamber) were treated with individual diastereoisomers (at 30 mM dose), and HUVEC invasiveness was measured. (C) DU145 cells were treated with individual diastereoisomers (at 30 mM dose) and conditioned media was collected. HUVEC were plated on matrigel along with 0.5% FBS or conditioned media from different treatment groups; and tube formation was analyzed. Representative photomicrographs of tubular network are shown at 100x.
